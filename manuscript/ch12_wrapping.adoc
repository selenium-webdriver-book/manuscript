= Chapter 12: Wrapping WebDriver and WebElement

:imagesdir: ../images/ch12_wrapping

In this chapter

* Using the `EventFiringWebDriver` web driver to capture screen-shots whenever a page loads
* Decorating web driver to allow you to use URL relative to base URL
* Using a HTTP proxy server to capture HTTP status codes
* Wrapping `WebElement` for HTML table with a `Table` interface
* Wrapping `By` locators inside enum constants

Wrapper an object can be use to to add new behavior, or modify existing behavior. This is know as the  *decorator pattern* footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern]. Wrapping web driver allows you add useful functionally to your automation code. For example, you could log each URL as it is opened, or close pop-ups that interrupt your tests. As you wrap the web driver, you can use the wrapped WebDriver in all you existing code, and get access to new features you add by wrapping it everywhere you use web driver, but still having all the features of the wrapped driver.

image::wrapping-driver.png[title="Wrapping WebDriver"]

By wrapping the driver, can add various different abilities to the driver without changing any existing code. This means that you can save a great deal of time if you decide they would be useful after you've started writing your test suite. For example:

* Log each URL opened, and each method invoked.
* Record whenever the page's title or headers change.
* Capture an image if an exception occurs.
* Capture an image after a method is invoked to create an animation of the browser.
* Automatically recognize HTTP 5xx and 4xx errors.
* Automatically log the user in.
* Closing pop-ups that might interrupt your code.

In this chapter, you will see an existing wrapper, the event firing web driver and see how to use it to capture screen-shots. You'll then see  an example of modifying the behavior of web driver's `get` method so that it can take URLs relative to a base URL. Finally, you see how to deal with very tough problem — capturing HTTP status codes.

By the end of the chapter you will have learned all the skills you need to wrap drivers.

.How do I find existing examples of wrapped drivers?
****
Drivers that decorate a web driver typically implement the `WrapsDriver` interface. If you're implementing you own wrapper you may wish to do this too.
****

== Event firing web driver

The standard Selenium Java library already container a wrapper, the *event firing web driver*. This wraps an existing driver to provide a method that allow you to register listeners which are invoked when certain actions (such as pages being loaded) are performed.

=== Taking screen-shots each time a page is loaded

The Event firing web driver allows you to write code that listens to requests send to a normal web driver and take action based on them. This technique shows you how to take a screen shot each time a page is loaded.



You want to take a screen-shot when pages are loaded to make it easier to trace problems in your code.



Wrap your driver in an EventFiringWebDriver and register a listener. To do this, you need to create an object the sub-classes `WebDriverEventListener`. This class has a large number of methods, so to avoid having to implement them all, you can sub-class `AbstractWebDriverEventListener`. This has empty implementations of each of the methods, so you only need to implement the ones you want.

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch12wrapping/tests/ScreenshotIT.java[ScreenshotIT.java]
----
EventFiringWebDriver driver = new EventFiringWebDriver(this.driver); // <1>

driver.register(new AbstractWebDriverEventListener() {

    @Override
    public void afterNavigateTo(String url, WebDriver driver) {
        File screenshotFile = ((TakesScreenshot) driver)
            .getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE); // <2>

        System.out.println("saved " + url + " as " + screenshotFile);
    }
});

driver.get("/index.html"); // <3>
----
<1> Wrap the existing driver.
<2> Take a screen-shot and save it to a file.
<3> This will navigate to a page, and therefore it will take a screenshot.



This shows an example of using the event firing web driver to wrap a web driver, and then save a screen-shot. The event firing web driver allows you to perform operations before and after a number of actions:

* Navigation to a URL, or forwards and backwards in history.
* Finding an element.
* Clicking.
* Entering text.
* Running a script.

It also allows you to perform additional actions when there is an exception using the `onException` method, though it doesn't allow you to perform any remedial actions should an exception occur.

`EventFiringWebDriver` is perfect for tasks such as taking screenshots, or logging web driver's behavior. Unless you throw an exception, `EventFiringWebDriver` does not allow you to change how you web driver behaves. You cannot change the arguments passed to your web driver, or change the value returned. To do this, we need to do something a bit more complex.

`EventFiringWebDriver` uses JDK dynamic proxies under the hood. We'll encounter them in more detail next.

== Base URL driver

In a chapter 7 we looked at a technique that allowed you to use base URL for your URLs in you test by inject the URL into you test class. To use that technique you need to modify every class that you wanted to use it in. This can be achieved by wrapping a web driver to automatically prefix the base URL if it is missing very time you invoke `get`.

=== Creating a driver that automatically prefixes URLs with a base URL



Injecting base URLs into tests is verbose, we want to have a driver that automatically prefixes a base URL.



Create a method that returns a web driver that wraps an existing web driver, but prefixes the URLs with a base URL.

The main item we need to achieve this is a driver that delegates all its calls to another driver, use the *delegate pattern* footnote:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern] to delegate the code to another class. We can then sub-class that driver to override methods with new implementations.

[[DelegatingWebDriver.v1]]
[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch12wrapping/v0_5/DelegatingWebDriver.java[DelegatingWebDriver.java]
----
class DelegatingWebDriver implements WebDriver {
    private final WebDriver driver;

    DelegatingWebDriver(WebDriver driver) {   <1>
        this.driver = driver;
    }

    @Override
    public Options manage() {
        return driver.manage();  <2>
    }

    @Override
    public void get(String url) {
        driver.get(url);
    }

    ...
}
----
<1> `DelegatingWebDriver` wraps `WebDriver`
<2> It only delegates the call to `WebDriver`

This class doesn't do very much on it's own, but lets look at what a sub-class of it can do.

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/framework/BaseUrlDriver.java[BaseUrlDriver.java]
----
class BaseUrlDriver extends DelegatingWebDriver {
    private final URI baseUrl;

    BaseUrlDriver(WebDriver driver, URI baseUrl) {
        super(driver);
        this.baseUrl = baseUrl;
    }

    @Override
    public void get(String url) {
        super.get(!url.contains("://") ? baseUrl + url : url);   <1>
    }
}
----
<1> It has some logic to use the url directly if the url has "://" in it, otherwise append it to `baseUrl` and call the `get` method in `DelegatingWebDriver`

This class overrides the `get` method. If the URL passed to is absolute (e.g. http://localhost:8080/index.html) then is passed to the delegate, but if it is relative (.e.g /index.html) then the base URI is prefixed to it. This can be used in place of any driver. It's convenient if the base URL can be changed using a system property:

[source,java]
----
new BaseUrlDriver(new FirefoxDriver(),
  URI.create(System.getProperty("webdriver.baseUrl")));
----

Finally, you can use it in your code:

[source,java]
----
driver.get("/index.html");
----

And set it to different locations when you run you tests:

[source,bash]
----
mvn ... -Dwebdriver.baseUrl="http://test-server"
----



The above example has a very specific use: to allow you to use the same tests to test applications on different hosts. To make this completely versatile, we need to implement all the interfaces that the `RemoteWebDriver` class implements. As `WebDriver` does not implement other useful interfaces such as `JavascriptExecutor`, you'll need to cast them as shown in listing <<DelegatingWebDriver>>.

[[DelegatingWebDriver]]
[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch12wrapping/v0_8/DelegatingWebDriver.java[DelegatingWebDriver.java]
----
class DelegatingWebDriver
    implements WebDriver, JavascriptExecutor, TakesScreenshot,  <1>
    HasInputDevices, HasCapabilities  {

    ...

    @Override
    public Object executeAsyncScript(String script, Object... args) {
        return ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeAsyncScript(script, args);  <2>
    }

    @Override
    public <X> X getScreenshotAs(OutputType<X> target)
        throws WebDriverException {
        return ((TakesScreenshot) driver).getScreenshotAs(target);   <3>
    }
    ...
}
----
<1> Implement these useful interfaces to make the `DelegatingWebDriver` more versatile
<2> Cast `driver` to `JavascriptExecutor` to execute its `executeAsyncScript` method
<3> Cast `driver` to `TakesScreenshot` to execute its `getScreenshotAs` method

[sidebar]
.Those Finds Interfaces
****
`RemoteWebDriver` also implements some other interfaces, `FindsById`, `FindsByClassName` and so on. Each of them provides 2 finders methods so there are 16 methods all together. Do we need to implement these interfaces is to make the `DelegatingWebDriver` compatible with Selenium library? The answer is no. If we implemented those interfaces, there would be 16 more methods in `DelegatingWebDriver` which not only would make it difficult to use, but also encourage people to write lengthy tests as well.

[source,java]
----
@Override
public WebElement findElementByXPath(String using) {
    return ((FindsByXPath) delegate).findElementByXPath(using);
}

@Override
public List<WebElement> findElementsByXPath(String using) {
    return ((FindsByXPath) driver).findElementsByXPath(using);
}
----

And we don't think those interfaces are necessary. Not only they are not necessary, but they are harmful as well. They would bloat the API and make `DelegatingWebDriver` hard to use.

On the contrary, `SearchContext` is a much better design, it only has two methods but these two methods can be used to handle all kinds of `Finds`, `By.ById`, `By.ByClassName` and so on.

[source,java]
----
public interface SearchContext {
    List<WebElement> findElements(By by);
    WebElement findElement(By by);
}
----

So we haven't actually implemented those interfaces. We don't encourage you to implement them either. Try to use `SearchContext` instead. But we are going to provide another interface to replace `SearchContext` as well. You will see that in next chapter.
****

You can also add new methods to you wrapped driver:

[source,java]
----
public void click(By by) {
    findElement(by).click();
}
----

We will cover this in Chapter 15 when we notice chained call makes the source call too long and we add this method to shorten the call. And we'll look at more ways to build your framework in part three of the book. In the next section you will see more complex examples where we add new functionality to a driver.

== How to find out a page’s HTTP status code

A *HTTP Status Code* is a number the server returns to the browser to indicate the status of the request. Common codes are:

* 200 OK
* 403 Unauthorized
* 404 Page Not Found
* 500 Internal Server Error
* 503 Server Temporarily Unavailable

These code are useful, as they can be used to quickly identify errors in pages, before anything else happens. However, WebDriver does not make the status code easily available.

=== Creating a WebDriver wrapper that captures HTTP status codes using a HTTP proxy



We'd like to be able to see the last HTTP status code of the last page loaded.



Use a HTTP proxy that captures the status codes, and expose those codes as a Spring bean in your tests.

To do this, we'll start a HTTP proxy server as part of our tests. We'll connect the driver to it, so that whenever the driver requests a page, we capture information about the page. We'll extend the Spring configuration from chapter 7 to do this. If you want a reminder about how this works, now is a good time to refer back to it.

. The test framework will start a proxy server
. When the test framework starts the driver and browser, it'll also tell the browser to use the proxy server
. When requests from the browser are sent, they will be routed via the proxy server
. When the framework starts the test, it'll inject both the driver and an object that reports the HTTP status code `HttpStatusCodeSupplier`
. The proxy server will capture the HTTP status code so that the test script can see what the status code was

image::using-a-proxy-server.png[title="Using A Proxy Server"]

Rather than write out own HTTP proxy server, we'll use *Lightbody Proxy* footnote:[https://bmp.lightbody.net]. This is a proxy that can capture the HTTP traffic of tests. Add this to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/pom.xml[pom.xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.littleshoot</groupId>
    <artifactId>littleproxy</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0-beta2</version>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>log4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
----

When we start our tests, we'll need to start the proxy server. This can be done by modifying the `WebDriverConfig` and adding a few new Spring beans to it:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/framework/WebDriverConfig.java[WebDriverConfig.java]
----
private static int freePort() throws IOException { //<1>
    try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(0)) {
        return serverSocket.getLocalPort();
    }
}

@Bean(destroyMethod = "abort") //<2>
public HttpProxyServer proxyServer(HttpFiltersSource httpFiltersSource)
    throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    InetSocketAddress inetSocketAddress =
        new InetSocketAddress(InetAddress.getLocalHost(), 0);
    return DefaultHttpProxyServer.bootstrap()
            .withNetworkInterface(inetSocketAddress)
            .withFiltersSource(httpFiltersSource)
            .withPort(freePort())
            .start();
}
----
<1> This method returns a port that is not in use currently.
<2> We must stop the server, Spring will not know how to do this automatically, so we must specify the names of the methods that Spring must call. This will make sure that the proxy server is shutdown at the end of the tests.

Add add this method to add the `PROXY` as a capability to `WebDriver`:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/framework/WebDriverConfig.java[WebDriverConfig.java]
----
@Bean
public DesiredCapabilities desiredCapabilities(HttpProxyServer proxyServer) {
    DesiredCapabilities capabilities =
        new DesiredCapabilities("firefox", "", Platform.ANY);
    // ...
    String httpProxy = proxyServer.getListenAddress().toString().substring(1); //<2>
    Proxy proxy = new Proxy().setHttpProxy(httpProxy).setSslProxy(httpProxy)
            .setFtpProxy(httpProxy).setSocksProxy(httpProxy);
    capabilities.setCapability(CapabilityType.PROXY, proxy); //<1>
    // ...
    return capabilities;
}
----
<1> Set the `PROXY` capability to tell WebDriver to use the proxy.
<2> Remove a leading "/"

Next you'll need a class to capture the last status code, as we'll as allow your test to access them. This class must implement the `HttpFiltersSource` interface.

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/framework/HttpStatusCodeSupplier.java[HttpStatusCodeSupplier.java]
----
public class HttpStatusCodeSupplier extends HttpFiltersSourceAdapter { //<1>

    private int httpStatusCode;

    @Override
    public HttpFilters filterRequest(HttpRequest originalRequest) {
        return new HttpFiltersAdapter(originalRequest) {
            public String uri;

            @Override
            public HttpResponse proxyToServerRequest(HttpObject httpObject) {
                if (httpObject instanceof HttpRequest) {
                    HttpRequest httpRequest = (HttpRequest) httpObject;
                    uri = httpRequest.getUri(); //<2>
                }
                return super.proxyToServerRequest(httpObject);
            }

            @Override
            public HttpObject serverToProxyResponse(HttpObject httpObject) {
                if (httpObject instanceof HttpResponse) {
                    HttpResponse httpResponse = (HttpResponse) httpObject;
                    if (uri.endsWith("html")) { //<3>
                        httpStatusCode = httpResponse.getStatus().code(); //<4>
                    }
                }
                return super.serverToProxyResponse(httpObject);
            }
        };
    }

    public int get() throws InterruptedException {
        if (httpStatusCode == 0) { //<5>
            throw new IllegalStateException(
                    "no request has yet been successfully intercepted");
        }
        return httpStatusCode;
    }
}
----
<1> `HttpFiltersSourceAdapter` implements the` `HttpFiltersSource` interface. Extending it reduces the amount of code needed.
<2> Save the URL for later.
<3> Only intercept pages that are HTML, assuming you don't want status codes for JavaScript or CSS resources.
<4> Save the status code in a field.
<5> If the status code is zero, no code has been captured yet.

This will need to be added to the `WebDriverConfig` too:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public HttpStatusCodeSupplier httpStatusCodeSupplier() {
    return new HttpStatusCodeSupplier();
}
----

Finally, you can use this in your code as per listing <<http-status-code-usage>> below.

[[http-status-code-usage]]
[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch12wrapping/tests/HttpStatusCodeIT.java[HttpStatusCodeIT.java]
----
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = WebDriverConfig.class)
public class HttpStatusCodeIT {

    @Inject
    private WebDriver driver;
    @Inject
    private HttpStatusCodeSupplier httpStatusCodeSupplier;

    @Test
    public void notFound() throws Exception {
        driver.get("/not-found.html");

        assertEquals(404, httpStatusCodeSupplier.get());
    }

    @Test
    public void resourceNotFound() throws Exception {
        driver.get("/resource-not-found.html");

        assertEquals(200, httpStatusCodeSupplier.get());
    }
}
----



This technique may not work if you are running your tests on Selenium Grid. This will be because the grid will need to connect to the proxy, running on your desktop PC, and your office network might not allow this. If you use a grid, then you probably want to test this first to make sure you can get any changes made necessary.

This approach could be extended to expose more information about the request. For example, how long it takes to complete, or the full HTTP request headers.

== Wrapping `WebElement` for HTML table with a `Table` interface

Not only we can wrap `WebDriver` interface, we can wrap `WebElement` interface as well.

In Chapter 2, we introduced a technique to locate cell element on a table using CSS or Xpath. But CSS and XPath locators are difficult to write and understand by many people. So we are going to introduce a new technique to allow people to locate table cell using its row and column number. And for functional tests purpose, both row and column number start from 1, so it make it easy to communicate with non technical people on the project.

For example, in the table cell, we will use (row number, column number) to indicate the position of the cell on the table,

.Header number, (row number, column number) of a table
[width="50%",cols="3",options="header"]
|======
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3
| (1,1)    | (1,2)    | (1,3)
| (2,1)    | (2,2)    | (2,3)
| (3,1)    | (3,2)    | (3,3)
| (4,1)    | (4,2)    | (4,3)
|======

Then we are going to introduce a technique to locate the contents on the table cell using its row number and column number.

=== Encapsulating table access Within a `Table` class

While tables are made up from rows, columns, headings, cells, you may find you want to access them by the cell. Lets look at a technique to do this.



You regularly have to create complex table locators and it is proving to be time-consuming to write, and difficult to maintain.



Encapsulate table access within a `Table` object. HTML tables have a standard layout, they have a head, and a body. Both contain cells, in the case of the body, using the `td` HTML tag.

Let's have a look at the methods you would want a table class to provide:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch12wrapping/table/Table.java[Table.java]
----
public interface Table extends WebElement {

    WebElement getBodyCell(int rowNumber, int columnNumber);

    int getWidth();

    int getBodyHeight();
}
----

We won't cover all the methods (`getWidth` and `getBodyHeight` are left as exercises to the user). Instead, we will focus in on the methods that gets cells. You may notice that the `Table` class extends the `WebElement` class; this means that you can use this object wherever you previously used a table's `WebElement`. You can drop it into existing code easily, and without sacrificing functionality.

You are going to create a simple implementation that is passed the table element from the page via the constructor as follows:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch12wrapping/table/SimpleTable.java[SimpleTable.java]
----
public class SimpleTable implements Table {
    private final WebElement tableElement;

    public SimpleTable(WebElement tableElement) {
        this.tableElement = tableElement;
    }
}
----

You would use this as follows:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch12wrapping/tests/TableIT.java[TableIT.java]
----
Table table = new SimpleTable(driver.findElement(By.id("users-table")));
----

The methods from `SearchContext` are directly delegated to the table
(the __decorator pattern__):

[source,java]
----
@Override
public WebElement findElement(By by) {
    return tableElement.findElement(by);
}

@Override
public List<WebElement> findElements(By by) {
    return tableElement.findElements(by);
}

...
----

The most interesting method is `WebElement getBodyCell(int rowNumber, int columnNumber)`. This method will need to find a cell by its row and column numbers. You can use the `TdBy` to do this.

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch12wrapping/table/SimpleTable.java[SimpleTable.java]
----
@Override
public WebElement getBodyCell(int rowNumber, int columnNumber) {
    return tableElement
            .findElement(By.tagName("tbody"))
            .findElement(TdBy.cellLocation(rowNumber, columnNumber));
}
----



You can build on this class to provide some more interesting and useful methods. For example, you can encapsulate the strategy of finding the correct column number:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch12wrapping/table/ColumnNumberFinder.java[ColumnNumberFinder.java]
----
class ColumnNumberFinder {

    private final SearchContext context;

    ColumnNumberFinder(SearchContext context) {
        this.context = context;
    }

    public int find(String headerText) {
        for (int columnNumber = 1; ; columnNumber++) {
            if (context
                    .findElement(By.cssSelector(String.format("th:nth-child(%d)", columnNumber)))
                    .getText().equals(headerText)) {
                return columnNumber;
            }
        }
    }
}
----

This is an example of the *strategy pattern* footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern]. It is a strategy for finding out something about the page. Let's look at an example of applying this strategy:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch12wrapping/table/SimpleTable.java[SimpleTable.java]
----
public class SimpleTable extends DelegatingWebElement implements Table {

    private final ColumnNumberFinder columnNumberFinder;

    public SimpleTable(WebElement delegate) {
        super(delegate);
        columnNumberFinder = new ColumnNumberFinder(
                delegate.findElement(By.tagName("thead"))); // <1>
    }

    @Override
    public WebElement getBodyCell(int rowNumber, String header) {
        int columnNumber = columnNumberFinder.find(header); // <2>
        return getBodyCell(rowNumber, columnNumber);
    }

    ...
}
----
<1> Create an object to find the column.
<2> Find the column.

.More on table
****
The technique about table here is to assist you to locate certain element
on table when you don't care about the content of entire table. If you need
to validate the contents on the table, this technique is not sufficient for
that purpose. We will cover comprehensive validation of table in Chapter 16.
****

== Wrapping `By` locators inside enum constants

Some pages can be very complex, and this means the XPaths and CSS selectors you have to use end up being very long. For example, on the shopping cart page (shown in figure <<shopping-cart>>), all the inputs have very long names:

[[shopping-cart]]
image::shopping-cart.png[title=Shopping cart http://localhost:8080/shopping-cart.html]

[source,html]
----
<input type="text"
       name="cartDS.shoppingcart_ROW0_m_orderItemVector_ROW0_m_quantity"
       class="form-control input-sm" value="1" size="2"/>
----

It would require the element locating code to be written like this:

[[long-by-name]]
[source,java]
.A `By` locator with a really long name
----
webDriver.findElement(
    By.name("cartDS.shoppingcart_ROW0_m_orderItemVector_ROW0_m_quantity "))
----

And it is not only this one element that has a long name, all of the elements are that long. You need a way to organize those locators to make the code less verbose. One way is to introduce a constant like `QUANTITY`:

[source,java]
----
private static final By QUANTITY
    = By.name("cartDS.shoppingcart_ROW0_m_orderItemVector_ROW0_m_quantity");
----

So the code becomes:

[source,java]
----
webDriver.findElement(QUANTITY);
----

The code is much cleaner after introducing this constant, but where is a good place for this constant?

Some people tend to put these constants in the same file they are being used in, with the constants at top. For a complex page, the constants will occupy a lot of lines of code to make that class long. The next thing you might do is to move those constants into a `Constants` class; this way the page becomes cleaner. But a constants class does not require the constants to be homogenic-—of the same type. We can enforce this using an enum.

=== Using enums to wrap and organize locators into cohesive groups

You might find your code starts to get quite full of locators--locators everywhere! This technique shows you how to organize them into a single place.



Code is cluttered with long locators that make it hard to understand.



Wrapping locators to their own enum class that acts as a locator factory. Enum was introduced in Java 5; we should take advantage of this language feature and use it to organize out locators to make our code more cohesive. Since enum implicitly extends `Enum`, it cannot extend `By`.

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch12wrapping/v0_7/ShoppingCartBySupplier.java[ShoppingCartBySupplier.java]
----
public enum ShoppingCartBySupplier {
    QUANTITY(
        By.name("cartDS.shoppingcart_ROW0_m_orderItemVector_ROW0_m_quantity"));

    private final By by;

    ShoppingCartBySupplier(By by) {
        this.by = by;
    }

    public By get() {
        return by;
    }
}
----

This can then be used as follows:

[[call_get]]
[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch12wrapping/tests/ShoppingCartBySupplierIT.java[ShoppingCartBySupplierIT.java]
----
driver.findElement(ShoppingCartBySupplier.QUANTITY.get())  <1>
----
<1> Call QUANTITY.get() to retrieve the `By` instance and pass it as the parameter to findElement

How cleaner it is when compared to Listing <<long-by-name>>.

.Real life example
****
We didn't invent this example, it is from a live website, http://manning.com.
Once you add a book to cart and go to shopping cart page, you can see this
quantity input field on that page to allow you to enter a bigger number(or at least we hope so).
The shopping cart was built using YUI and it is no longer a choice to do UI.
We like Material-UI and we have example in Chapter 18 to automate Material-UI
datepicker. When automating datepicker, we use this technique extensively, so
it will be helpful if you can master this technique.

A benefit of having an enum is that it can be a great reference for new or inexperienced team members. When they join your project, before adding new constants, they can check whether the constants are already there. If they're not familiar with certain search mechanisms, for example, they can use the existing constants as examples to learn how to produce the ones they want. For example, developers who are interested in learning
XPath selectors can check the suppliers to learn how to come up with new locators. By organizing them in one place improves the cohesion of the code and will reduce duplication in the system.

Can you see something we can improve in that example? Let us have a look that enum again. Even the locators are organized properly, it still needs to be call `get` as shown in Listing <<call_get>>. Calling `get` once may not be an issue, but it will become annoying if you need to call it over and over again. Is there a way to just pass the enum itself without calling `get`?

Yes, we will introduce a new technique to simplify this method calling.

=== Expose locator enums as a `Supplier<By>` interface

With the introduction of the enum constants, we don't need to use the locators with long names any more. It is an improvement. But there is still some problem lingering in the code base we need to address.



As in Listing <<call_get>>, you always need to call the `get` method before you can pass the `By` locator in the enum as the parameter to the finder methods of `Browser` and `Element`. It will add up the complexity of the automation code when many locators are used.

If we can make a call with enum constant `QUANTITY` directly as the parameter for method `findElement`, it will simplify the method calling as,

[source,java]
----
driver.findElement(QUANTITY) <1>
----

The code looks better than the one need to call `get`. And it is not difficult to achieve this.



The solution to this problem is relatively simple. What we need to do is to have the enum implement `Supplier<By>` interface and follow some conversions.

* Organize the same type of `By` locators inside same enum.
* Name the enum `Name`,`Id`,`LinText` and so on.
* Use string type as constructor parameter and convert the string into the `By` type in the constructor of the enum
* Implement the `get` method from `Supplier<By>` interface and provide a `toString` method

For example, the following is a `ByName` enum with 2 constants defined.

[[ByName]]
[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch12wrapping/v0_8/Name.java[Name.java]
----
public enum Name implements Supplier<By> {  <1>
    EMAIL("email"),
    QUANTITY("cartDS.shoppingcart_ROW0_m_orderItemVector_ROW0_m_quantity");

    private final By by;

    ByName(String by) {
        this.by = By.name(by);  <2>
    }

    @Override
    public By get() {  <3>
        return by;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {  <4>
        return by.toString();
    }
}
----
<1> It implements a `Supplier<By` interface
<2> It constructs a `By.ByName` locator in its constructor
<3> It returns the `By.ByName` locator it wraps
<4> It provides a `toString()` method for debugging message.

When you use `Name.EMAIL.get()`, it will return you a `By.name("email")` locator and `Name.QUANTITY.get()` will return you a `By.name("cartDS.shoppingcart_ROW0_m_orderItemVector_ROW0_m_quantity")`. But we will change the method parameter to use `Supplier<By>` as parameter so you can pass the enum as parameter without calling its `get` method.

So we change the methods in `Browser` to take `Supplier<By>` as parameter.

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/framework/DelegatingSearchContext.java#L29-L32[DelegatingSearchContext.java]
----
@Override
public Element findElement(Supplier<By> by) {    <1>
   return new Element(                <3>
     super.findElement(by.get())      <2>
   );
}
----
<1> Use a `Supplier<By>` as the parameter
<2> We still need to call the get() method before passing to the findElement method of `WebDriver` and `WebElement`
<3> We need wrap the `WebElement` using `Element` so this method is available to the caller

Now you can just directly use the enum as parameter.

[source,java]
----
driver.findElement(Name.QUANTITY)
----

You can see, not only we wrap `By` inside an enum, but we created a cleaner interface for other classes to use as well. So you no longer need to call the `get` method of the enum before you can use it as the parameter for finder methods.



When you work on a complex web application, with many things need to be located, the code will be much cleaner without calling `get` method repeatedly. From now on, we will continue to use this technique through out the rest of the book. To save paper, when we list locator enums similar to Listing <<ByName>>, we will omit `get()` and `toString()` methods and just provide the following definition and leave out the rest.

[source,java]
----
EMAIL("email"),
QUANTITY("cartDS.shoppingcart_ROW0_m_orderItemVector_ROW0_m_quantity");
----

You will see extensive usage of this technique in part 3.

== Summary

* Using a wrapper can solve a variety of problems.
* The `EventFiringWebDriver` is a built-in wrapped driver, and it's perfect if you want to observe web driver.
* Decorated class can be used in existing code without changing that code. They are more complex, and more powerful. They can be used to change the behavior of web driver.
* You can use a HTTP proxy server to capture HTTP status code. You can also capture other information about the web pages your are testing.
* Providing an interface to access table cells on a `WebElement` representing a HTML table.
* Wrapping `By` locators inside enum and let the enum implement `Supplier<By>` to simplify parameter passing

This is the end of part two. In part three of this book we will look at how you can build a framework for you tests to run in that will reduce the amount of code you need write.
